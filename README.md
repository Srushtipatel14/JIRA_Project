# Jira Clone with Role-Based Access

A simplified Jira-like project management system with **role-based access control**, built using **Node.js**, **Next.js 15**, and **MongoDB**.  

Admins can create projects, assign tasks, and manage members, while members can only update the status of tasks assigned to them. Authentication is handled via **JWT tokens stored in cookies**.
